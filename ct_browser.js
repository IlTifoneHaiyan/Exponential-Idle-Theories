Despite thinking that they would be punished for such arrogance, you decided to give it a try, and the generating function was born. A generating function is a formal power series: it is in some ways similar to i. It is not always defined, but can still be used for calculations. For example, the sum of 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... is equal to 1/(1-x) when x is between -1 and 1. We define the nth term of it 1/(1-x) as the coefficient of x^n, which here is always 1.", link: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Solarion4131/Exponential-idle/main/Generating%20Functions.js'},
